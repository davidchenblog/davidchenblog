Define Recording Ratio:
Recording ratio is the frame interval after which an automatic screenshot is taken.
For a 30 frame per second (fps) video, entering 300 as Recording ratio would take a
screenshot every 10 seconds and 1500 would make it 50 seconds.
To find out the fps of a movie, open a video and go to Tools > Codec information [Ctrl + J].

對於30fps影片來說，設定300會每10秒截圖一次。設定1500則每50秒截圖一次。
