告知對方收據不見了~

對方回覆:
Hi, 

Thank you for your email 

In this case, I suggest contacting the shop directly and asking them to reissue an original receipt.
Once it’s issued, the shop needs to send the original receipt along with a filled-in cover letter
(see attached) via post to the address mentioned in my previous email 

Note that envelopes sent via standard mail are untraceable. For faster delivery and tracking
purposes of your documents, you may ask the shop to use registered mail or courier. 

As soon as we get the requested documents, your refund will be processed accordingly. 

An approved Czech Republic form is valid for 6 months 

Thank you for understanding

結論:原收據遺失需聯絡當初的店家要求將原收據及填上附件表格後
再郵寄或掛號給Global Blue才能進行退款流程。
時效在六個月內 :(
